# Writing_Samples

Welcome to my writing smaples repository. Here I have made available a translated version of my BA thesis at ITAM (ITAM_Thesis_Eng.pdf) and my Master thesis at Tilburg University (Tilburg_Thesis.pdf). Here is a brief description regarding the length of both documents:
* This version of my BA thesis does not include the appendix nor some IRFs in order to avoid exceeding the 20 pages limit, including references.
* I modified letter size and margins in order to make the thesis 30 pages long (references, acknowledgements, index, and cover page included) in order for it to fit within 30 pages.

I want to note that my BA thesis is a theoretically stronger paper, being a DSGE model, while my MSc thesis is more applied in nature, addressing the use of Neural Networks for inflation forcasting. I hope you find these files helpful.
